title: Machine Learning
lang: Machine learning aims to transfer high-accuracy results from DFT calculations into energy parameters for molecular dynamics, enabling the construction of highly accurate potential functions. This approach facilitates precise simulations of the interactions between polymers and inorganic surfaces.
